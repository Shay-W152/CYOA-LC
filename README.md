Game Mechanics
    The buttons change to fit scenario 
    
    The game presents a series of scenarios and challenges the player to make choices that affect the outcome.
    
    Each scenario provides a description and a set of options the player can choose from.
    
    Players must carefully consider their choices as they can impact the story progression and the game's ending.
    
    The game may include riddles, or challenges that require the player to think crtically and problem-solve. (no moon logic)

    Puzzle Ideas: memory puzzles, logic questions, language/decrypt puzzles

Coding 
    I might be able to recycle the code from my tic tac toe assignment when it comes to click and responding functions 
    
    I also need to figure out how to have my text <p> wrap around my images 
    
    I want to make the ui also readable on phones with the max width and min width functions on CSS

narrative flow: 

THE HORROR FROM OUR PAST!
Start with code for the first room and first few options the ncontinuew from there 

opening scene/ Transport Shuttle: 
Text: 
Youre a space age private detective after years of working with the new mars federation you had enough with red tape and politics you no longer want to help anyone but, you dont have any other skills solving mysteries is in you blood now 
youve been called to an abondoned space trawler that belongs to a moisture farmer who has family on new earth-2 you think "connections like that why is he a moisture farmer?" before you can extrapulate on that 
You feel the gravity shift as your pilot docks on to the moisture famers trawler, youll never get used to the smell of artifical gravity
Transport Shuttle options:
option 1:
1. look around 
outcome: 
you see your pilot clicking on and off the radio no one seems to respond from the ship 
option 2:
2. look out the port hole
outcome:
you see the emptiness and void of The Expanse eventhough you were born in it, others see majesty you can only feel small and terrified 


option 3: 
3. head for the dock bridge (brings up ship interior png.) (this is the only option that brings up a new picture)  
outcome:
you make your way across the high tech brisge extending from your ship to the next 
scene ship docking bay:
text: 
you walk onboard the ship's docking bay as your senses still adapting to the artificial o2 and gravity you can already tell something isnt right on this vessel its far too quiet even with the engine being turned off a moisture farmers trawler should have atleast 10 people  you dont see or hear a single soul. You can see 3 door ways to the north, west, and, east of you 
Ship Docking bay options:
option:
1. go back out the door you came in through  
outcome:
it was too spooky you went back to your ship and left (changes to pic of victory screen) 
2. go north (changes to png of command deck )
outcome:
you decide the smartest course of action is to head to the command deck and run a systems diagnostic 
command deck: 
you walk into the commmand deck on any other ship this is the heart of the operations, this isnt any other ship, as you come into the room you almost fall off you feet on the over head view the words "The answer lies in the forgotten flora. Seek the metal of life where green once thrived." are scrawled in a bluish green material. the command deck is empty but, even through your suit you get a spine tingle sensation you connect to the systems diagnostics a bright green screen comes up with black text. you run therough the basic systems commands checking through the obvious culprits the results ping and echo through the command deck: engines: off, oxygen: acceptable levels, grav-projector: unstable, escape pods: 4 of 5 launched/ untraceable
Command Deck options:
    option 1:go to the oxygen/ grav-projector room (this brings you to the option of 'go east')
    option 2:go to the escape pods (this brings you the option of 'go west')
    option 3: go back to dock (this brings you to option 'head for the dock bridge') (brings up ship interior png.) 


3.go east: (changes to pic of destroyed tech room png )
oxygen / grav-projector room: 
Text: you take the room going east you walk through a few corridors coming around the corner you can see the ominuos blue lights streaking out the door way. You turn on the flash light in your suit and make your way inside  your field of vision being limited to the 3 feet in front of you and a few inches on either side. You try to make your way across the pipes and tubing that are definetly supposed to be inside of the walls and not on the floor. After struggling to make it past the wires you figure out the issue with the gravity and oxygen someone or something had been using it as a scratching post the claw marks arent deep and thank fully they werent able to penetrate the admantium shell you contemplate "damn i wish my suit was made of that" 
Oxygen room options:
1. scan the claw marks
    outcome: 
    after a few seconds your device beeps as you stare into the small palm sized scren the only light in the room is the green glare bouncing off your visor it reads back "species recognized: Rinorea niccolifera Origin: Terra-P Status: Extinct"
    you sigh in frustration you told your engineer to mod your scanner to use words you actually understand. After a few seconds of space googling you get that same spine tingling feeling you had when you saw your first floater 
    this is an alloy eating life form first discovered on Terra-P the origin planet of the human race a planet thought lost millenia ago. how do they have this life form? what were they doing with it? you have too many questions running through your mind 
    you take a deep breath and clear your mind your mission is to find the farmer and come back alive. 
    Sub-options oxygen room:
    sub-option 1: look around 
    outcome: You see the status menus on a nearby console it reads two errors "missing escape pods 4/5 and systems malfunction on command deck" 
    Sub-option 2: go to the command deck (this brings you to the option of 'go north')
    Sub-option 3: go to the escape pods (this brings you to the option of 'go west') 
2.You know when your supposed to leave a room you walk back to the cargo bay (this brings you to the option 'head for the dock bridge')


4.go west:(changes to escape pod room png)
escape pod/ engines room:
Text: You decided to head over to the Escape Pods there may be some clues as to where everyone went you estimate even in an old school trawler like this the average escape shuttle would fit 4 comfortably, and from the riots on Centari-Minor you know it'll fit 6 uncomfortably. You walk into the silent room, you bring up the your visor communicator as your pilot calls you from your vessel. Your comm display clicks on and he tells you 'Hey Choom just wanted to let you know your contract only covers 59870 parsecs and we are at 49870 I'd hurry up if I were you' 
Escape pod room options:  
1.Calm Answer "dont call me Choom, ill be done soon just keep the thrusters on"
    outcome:
    You hear the pilots comms click back on "roger that choom" (This brings you to the other 2 'escape pod/engine room options')
2. Rude Answer "screw you! I am going to take all the time i need"
    outcome for rude response: That hurt the pilots feelings he left you die alone in space like you always thought you would :/ (game over screen)

3. Ignore his warning and look around the room for the escape pod functions (this bring up the escape pod png)
    outcome: you find the escape pod shuttles there are scorch marks coming out of 4 of the 5 ports when you take a closer look at the missing pods you notice theres a leg coming out of the 5th pod bay 
    sub-options for escape pod:
    option 1: kick the leg and wait for a response 
    outcome for kick the leg: theres not response (this brings you back to 'sub-options for escape pod') 
    option 2:  walk to the entrance of the escape pod and look inside 
    outcome: as you walk around the corner you see the most horrible sight black and blue vines are stretching and piercing his decaying flesh. above his head someone wrote "The answer lies in the forgotten flora. Seek the metal of life where green once thrived." you can see his chest compress and decompress My god hes still alive! you avoid touching any of the vines withdrawing your pistol and you take aim at the slowly decaying man and you shoot him to put him out of his misery.
       

4.ignore his warning and scan the room for the engine 
    outcome: You recall your training before joiing the guardian corps when you were fighting on the side of the browncoats in the war on Mahalva prime you were the engineer for your platoon. You run a quick diagnostics on your palm screen the it reads back to you "the engines are fully functional" and you bring up to the options menu
    sub-options for the engine:
    1. self-destruct (maybe avoid this)
        outcome for self destruct: choose a timer for the ship and to incenrate itself 
            options for self-destruct: 
            opton 1: immediate 
            outcome for immediate: you wanted to make sure the life form is gone for good a lttle too sure maybe? (this takes you to game over screen) 
            option 2: 5 minutes 
            outcome for 5 minutes: you set up the timer for just enough time that you can make it back to your transport and leave the immediate area you contained the contamination you return to your employers and tell them everyone on that ship died (victory screen)
    2.navigation protocols (you can aim the ship and thrust using this)
        options for navigation protocols:
        option 1: send the ship into Kepler-47 
        outcome for navigation protocol option 1: you steer the ship in the direction of the sun and then race back to dock only to reallize that it took you too long to calculate the trajectories and your transport ship left without you. You look over The Expanse one last time before you go down with the ship regretting every moment of your life that brought you here (this takes you to the game over screen)
        option 2: send the ship to a nearby abondoned planet 
        outcome for navigation protocol option 2: you have no need to calcualte the trajectory for down you just set it on a timer and run for your transport. you set up the timer for just enough time that you can make it back to your transport and leave the immediate area you contained the contamination you return to your employers and tell them everyone on that ship died (victory screen) 
    
3. go back to dock: (this brings you to option 'head for the dock bridge') (brings up ship interior png.)
